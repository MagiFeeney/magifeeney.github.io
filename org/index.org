I am a second-year Ph.D. student in Computer Science at National University of Singapore advised by [[https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~leews/][Prof. Wee Sun Lee]] with a focus on *reinforcement learning*.

I received my Bachelor's degree in Statistics from Northwestern Polytechnical University, where I studied mathematics and statistics.

* Research
I am broadly interested in reinforcement learning and decision-making. My current research focuses on *active exploration*, *structured memory*, *multi-step world models*, and *hierarchical RL*. The ultimate goal is to realize autonomous AI systems for a wide spectrum of applications that benefit the society.

The core research problems that I am actively working on and will continue to answer are

- *Sample Efficiency* How to acquire skills and adapt to novel situations with minimal data is a long-standing challenge in the field.
- *World Models* Predictive models with a universal state representation enable fine-grained planning and reasoning.
- *Intrinsic Motivation* Without hand-crafted rewards, how could an agent maintain its well-being and possibly refine its policy?
- *Hierarchy* Whatever level of abstraction occurs, hierarchy persists temporally and spatially in both decision-making and vision.
- *Uncertainty* Understanding the world by reducing epistemic uncertainty, and influencing it by maximizing reward in the face of aleatoric uncertainty.

* Highlighted Works
